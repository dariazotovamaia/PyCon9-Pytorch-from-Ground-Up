# pytorch from ground up
This is the repository for **PyTorch From Ground Up** tutorial and [**Pycon 9**](https://pycon.it) talk slides. It features Jupyter Notebook Slides html file, and training notebooks

## Knowledge Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes familiarity with Python and Numpy.

## Tutorial Prerequisites
Python3 is required to run this tutorial. You also will need some libraries from SciPy package (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas), Jupyter Notebook support, and Pytorch 0.3.0 or newer.

The simpliest way to maintain Python with all these libraries as well as many others is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). You can Find Pytorch installation instructions on the [Pytorch page](http://pytorch.org).

CUDA availability is NOT required, but still, Life is short -- use a GPU!

## How to Use
Our tutorial git has no submodules. To download the tutorial, use 

```
git clone TODO
```

To run the Jupyter Notebook Slides as at Jupyter Day Atlanta 2018 talk, you can use following command:

```
jupyter nbconvert pytorch-fgu.ipynb --to slides --post serve
```
